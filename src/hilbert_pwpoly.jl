# --- Parallel Hilbert primitive H∥ for a piecewise-polynomial g ---
# H∥[g](ζ) = ∫ g(v)/(v − ζ) dv with g piecewise-poly on a v-grid. Each cell
# [v_i, v_{i+1}] with poly p(v)=Σ c_k v^{k-1} integrates in closed form: divide
# p(v) by (v−ζ) → p(v)=q(v)(v−ζ)+p(ζ), so
#   ∫ p/(v−ζ) = ∫ q  +  p(ζ)·log((v_{i+1}−ζ)/(v_i−ζ)).
# The direct Cauchy integral uses the principal log branch. The Landau-causal
# continuation adds the same 2πi in-cell lower-half correction as MPDES.

    cell_hilbert(coeffs, vl, vr, ζ) -> Complex

Closed-form `∫_{vl}^{vr} p(v)/(v − ζ) dv` for one cell, `p(v) = Σ_k coeffs[k] v^{k-1}`
(monomial basis, ascending degree). Exact for all complex `ζ` (including off-axis
and, by limit, on the real axis away from `[vl,vr]`).

Synthetic division gives `p(v) = q(v)(v−ζ) + p(ζ)`; `∫q` is a plain polynomial
integral and `p(ζ)·log((vr−ζ)/(vl−ζ))` carries the branch cut as one complex log
of the ratio — the branch-cut invariant (spec §1).

    hilbert_pwpoly(coeffs, nodes, ζ) -> Complex

Parallel Hilbert integral `H∥[g](ζ) = ∫ g(v)/(v − ζ) dv` for a piecewise
polynomial `g`: `nodes` are the `N+1` cell boundaries (ascending), `coeffs[i]`
is the monomial-coefficient vector (ascending degree) of `g` on cell
`[nodes[i], nodes[i+1]]`. Sums `cell_hilbert` over cells.

Landau-causal and single-valued across `Im ζ → 0` by construction (each cell
uses the log-of-ratio form). For `ζ` inside the support the physical sheet is
`Im ζ > 0`; the result continues analytically to `Im ζ < 0`.
