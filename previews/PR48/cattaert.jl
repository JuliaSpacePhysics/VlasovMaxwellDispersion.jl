# # Kappa-Maxwellian Plasma — Cattaert 2007
#
# A single electron population with strongly non-Maxwellian along the field
# (`κ∥ = 1`) and nearly Maxwellian across it (`κ⟂ = 200`), oblique at `θ = 30°`.
# We first track four known electromagnetic branches from a single seed,
# then the seedless global solver rediscovers them all at once.
# Verified against [PlasmaBO.jl `rlp_Cattaert07` case](https://juliaspacephysics.github.io/PlasmaBO.jl/dev/rlp_Cattaert07/).

# point-by-point against the BOPBK reference. Near `k → 0` the branches curve
# steeply, so tracking runs on a 2×-subdivided `kρ` grid and compares at the
# reference points. Branch 4's `kρ = 10⁻⁴` endpoint is excluded: there its
# `ω ≈ −3×10⁻⁶` has merged into the `ω = 0` light-term pole of `det 𝒟` (the
# reference value is itself numerically zero) — below that separation no root
# tracker can hold a branch identity.

# 2ωce` are genuine but heavily damped kinetic roots (`Im ω ≲ −0.03`)
# Black dots overlay the BOPBK reference to confirm the discovered branches sit
