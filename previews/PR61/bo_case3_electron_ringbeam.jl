# # Oblique electron ring-beam instability (Guo et al. 2025, Case 3)
#
# Case 3 of the [BO vs ALPS benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.14439): an oblique
# instability at `θ = 40°` driven by an electron *ring-beam* — a shifted Maxwellian with a
# parallel drift `v_dz = 0.1c` and a perpendicular ring speed `v_dr = 0.05c` — neutralised by
# a cold-ish Maxwellian electron core. The paper reports that BO and ALPS agree throughout the
# spectrum, so both trustworthy targets collapse onto the single curve reproduced here.

# ## Plasma setup
#
# SI parameters (paper Table I), normalized to the electron gyrofrequency `|ωce|`; velocities
# in units of `c`. VMD's `GaussianRing` is the literal shifted-Gaussian of Eq. (7),
# `f ∝ exp[-(v∥-v_dz)²/c∥² - (v⊥-v_dr)²/c⊥²]`, with `vth = √(2qT/m)/c = c∥ = c⊥`.
# The table lists no ions: the total electron density `1e6 m⁻³` is charge-neutralised by an
# immobile background, so ions are omitted (adding cold protons leaves fig. 3 unchanged — the
# unstable modes live at `ω ~ ωce`, far above any ion response).

# ## Seedless survey
#
# `k` is swept over `k·λₑ ∈ [0.3, 35]` (`λₑ = c/ωpe`, electron inertial length); `kunit`
# converts to VMD's `k c/ωce` units. Over this range `Λr = k⊥ v_dr/ωce ≲ 4 < 10`, so the
# parabolic-cylinder closure of `GaussianRing` is accurate and `SeparableVDF` is not needed.
# The `ω` box spans `Re ω ∈ [0, 10] ωce` and reaches deep below the real axis so the
# red/green branches stay tracked through their strongly Landau-damped extension to
# `k·λₑ = 35` (the plot later zooms to `γ ∈ [-0.4, 0.4]`, mirroring fig. 3).

# ## Verification against BO/ALPS
#
# The survey resolves three growing branches. Their peak growth rates and the wavenumbers of
# those peaks are compared with values read from fig. 3(b) of the paper (BO and ALPS agree
# there to plotting accuracy).

        g[j], γref, x[j], kref)
end

# VMD gives `γ_peak = 0.326, 0.263, 0.133` at `k·λₑ = 10.1, 17.1, 9.0`, matching the paper's
# `≈ 0.33, 0.25, 0.13`. The strongest branch also reproduces the characteristic notch in `γ`
# near `k·λₑ ≈ 4` and the negative-then-positive excursion of the flattening `ω_r → 4 ωce`
# mode — features visible in fig. 3.
